I currently work as a **Software Engineer** at [Stripe](https://www.stripe.com).
I'm part of the team building [Issuing](https://stripe.com/issuing), a product
that allows businesses to create and manage physical and virtual cards.

I am primarily a **backend engineer**, and I'm proficient in **Ruby**,
**Python**, **PostgreSQL**, and other technologies.

Previously, I was a **Senior Software Engineer and Tech Lead** at
[Transfix](https://transfix.io), where I built SaaS products, and a **Senior
Software Engineer** at [Warby Parker](https://www.warbyparker.com), where my
focus was on business systems.

I earned my Bachelor's Degree in **Psychology** and **English** from the
[University of Virginia](http://www.virginia.edu). I also minored in **Computer
Science**.

In my free time, I love to **travel**, [take **photos**][Instagram], and ride
the **subway**. Sometimes I even do these things simultaneously.

I live in **New York City** with my husband, Logan McClellan.
