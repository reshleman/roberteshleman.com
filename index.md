I currently work as a **Software Engineer** at [Warby
Parker](https://www.warbyparker.com), where my primary focus is building
*accurate*, *scalable* systems for inventory and accounting.

Previously, I was a **Web Developer** at [Character
Lab](https://www.characterlab.org), an education non-profit that provides
educators with resources to develop students' character strengths --- habits
like grit, gratitude, and curiosity.

I earned my Bachelor's Degree in **Psychology** and **English** from the
[University of Virginia](http://www.virginia.edu), where I also minored in
**Computer Science**. I'm a graduate of the [Metis](https://www.thisismetis.com)
**Ruby on Rails bootcamp**.

In my free time, I love to **travel**, [take **photos**][Instagram], and ride
the **subway**. Sometimes I even do these things simultaneously.

I live in **New York City** with my husband, Logan McClellan.
